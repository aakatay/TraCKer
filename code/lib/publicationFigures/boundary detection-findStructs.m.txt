4. boundary convolved with 3x3

5. boundary substracted from 5x5 conv (step2)

 - small or sparse structures eliminated

 - each structure is processed with the following steps individually

12. inverted

13. boundary detected

In order to find the boundaries of the structures, the recruitment images are convolved with a 3x3 matrix and converted to binary. The resulting image is inverted and convolved with a 3x3 matrix and converted to binary. The resulting image is inverted again. The boundaries of the resulting shape gave the structure boundaries
